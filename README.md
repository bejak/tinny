A Java project to print multiple PDFs in a defined order and each with a defined print setting


I have kind of made this using VBA for work purposes but with multiple work arounds.

What I would like this program to do is to be able to select multiple PDF paths put them in order and apply to each one 
a predefined print setting. 

This should help those in administrative roles where they need to print out multiple pdfs in a specific order with specific print settings.

What the user will be able to do. select files, define print profile, apply print profile to a file in the list.
